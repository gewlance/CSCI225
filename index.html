            <p>Hello world! My name is Lance, I enjoy playing bass.
            I have played a while for my church. My favorite genres are funk,
            prog rock, and alt rock. Victor Wooten is one of my favorite bass 
            players, I enjoy his technicality and his sense of rhythm. Other 
            than that, I enjoy managing things like my money and creating side
            goals and projects for myself. Here is a picture of me with a bundle 
            of FREE collards that I got from a customer that I delivered to. 
            I typically enjoy more back end, computational, and logistical work.
            This class does push me to learn more about front end and displays,
            which is nice. I enjoy art and design, so hopefully I can find ways 
            to implement that into my website.
